# WebQx Watermark Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for maintaining WebQx branding and watermarks across the clinic repository.

## Overview

The WebQx watermark ensures consistent branding and ownership identification across all project documentation and materials. This watermark should be maintained in all future updates to preserve brand integrity.

## Watermark Implementation

### 1. README.md Watermark
The main README.md file includes a WebQx watermark section that should be preserved:

```markdown
---

<div align="center">

**Powered by WebQx**

*Innovative healthcare solutions for the digital age*

</div>

---
```

### 2. Documentation Files
All new documentation files (*.md, *.txt, *.rst) should include the WebQx attribution:

- For Markdown files: Use the centered watermark format shown above
- For plain text files: Include "Powered by WebQx" in the header or footer
- For code documentation: Use appropriate comment syntax for WebQx attribution

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding New Documentation
1. Include WebQx watermark in a non-intrusive location
2. Use consistent formatting and messaging
3. Ensure watermark doesn't interfere with content readability

### When Updating Existing Files
1. Preserve existing WebQx watermarks
2. Do not remove or modify watermark content
3. If restructuring documents, maintain watermark placement

### Watermark Standards
- **Text**: "Powered by WebQx"
- **Tagline**: "Innovative healthcare solutions for the digital age"
- **Placement**: Preferably at the top or bottom of documents
- **Format**: Centered and visually separated from main content

## File Types and Adaptability

### Markdown Files (.md)
Use HTML div tags for centered alignment:
```html
<div align="center">
**Powered by WebQx**
*Innovative healthcare solutions for the digital age*
</div>
```

### Plain Text Files (.txt)
```
===============================================
          Powered by WebQx
  Innovative healthcare solutions for the digital age
===============================================
```

### Source Code Files
Use appropriate comment syntax:
```
// Powered by WebQx - Innovative healthcare solutions for the digital age
/* Powered by WebQx - Innovative healthcare solutions for the digital age */
# Powered by WebQx - Innovative healthcare solutions for the digital age
```

## Performance Considerations

- Watermarks are text-based to minimize repository size
- No external image dependencies required
- Minimal impact on load times or repository performance
- Watermarks do not affect code functionality

## Compliance and Validation

### Before Committing Changes
1. Verify watermark presence in modified documentation
2. Check formatting consistency
3. Ensure watermark doesn't conflict with existing content
4. Validate that watermark is visible and readable

### Regular Maintenance
- Review watermark presence during code reviews
- Update guidelines as branding requirements evolve
- Ensure new team members understand watermark requirements
